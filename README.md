# Azure DevOps - Take home assignment

In this assignment you will take use of Infrastructure As Code, a concept that is an important part of cloud development.

The technology for deploying infrastructure will be Azure Resource Manager or ARM templates.

Since we most often want to reuse already existing ARM-templates within our organization, where the naming conventions is implemented, you will be provided with a couple of templates for creating an Application Insights, App Service Plan and App Service.

Your task is to complete the master template (sof-exchangerate.json) and the parameter file (sof-exchangerate-dit-parameters.json) to create a hosting environment for your exchange rate api using the preprepared organization templates.

Master Azure Resurce Manager template and parameter file for the scale unit 'exchangerate':
* sof-exchangerate.json
* sof-exchangerate-dit-parameters.json

Azure Resurce Manager templates already created by the organizaion:
* template-applicationinsights.json
* template-appserviceplan-windows.json
* template-service.json
